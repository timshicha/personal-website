        <h2>30-Second Summary</h2>
        <p>Bin Challenge is a system that allows users to track the angles
            of their upper and lower arm. The project consists of 2 parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The physical system consisting of:
                <ul>
                    <li>A lightweight microcontroller</li>
                    <li>Two angle measuring modules</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The iPhone app</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <p>
            The physical system is attached to an arm and measures the angle at which the
            sensors are tilted. The app then fetches this data from the microcontroller via
            WiFi and uses it to display the arm in the app.

        <h2>Inspiration: Looking strong in front of your coworkers</h2>
        <p>
            Losing sucks. Losing as a result of an unfairly ruled competition sucks even more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently an electrical assembly technician, so we scrap a ton of wire. One day,
            as I was talking to my lead, I randomly picked up the bin we used for scrap wire and
            held it in front of me, arm straight and parallel to the ground. An exciting idea
            struck my lead: create a leaderboard to see how long each person can hold the bin in
            front of themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            I attached wires to both handles and put a metal pole through the wires so that it
            would be more comfortable to hold it:
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/binDrawing.jpeg" id="binDrawingImg" src="Drawing of metal bar tied horisontally to a garbage bin using wires.">
        <p>
            Most of us held the bin straight in front of us, parallel to the ground. However, I
            began to see some people drop their arm really low and still continue the attempt. We
            tried to come up with a justice system to ensure that the competition was fair, but
            there were still disagreements on whether a person dropped their arm too low.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then one day, I came in to work to see that the previous record was beat by a 
            Cross-Fitter from our office (alledgedly also the strongest guy in the comapny). My lead
            claimed that the fine individual held his arm straight, but I was still motivated to
            implement a system that would serve all of us justice.

        <h3>Converting the angle sensors into levels</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest problem I had was finding level modules that a microcontroller could read.
            My only solution was to use angle sensor modules and attach 3-D printed levers to them.
            Gravity pulls the lever down, rotating angle sensor rotor. I also attached a few pennies
            to the end of the lever; this weight really helps the lever stay pointing down.
        </p>

            <img src="./assets/leverDown.jpeg" id="leverDownImg" alt="Angle sensor with lever hanging down.">
        </div>
        <h3>Making the levels arm-attachable</h3>
        <p>
            The final step for the level sensors was to modify them in a way to make it
            easy to attach them to the arm. I found that D-ring belts worked very well for this.
        </p>

        <h3>Programming the microcontroller</h3>
        <p>
            I programmed the microcontroller to read the output values of the angle sensors and store
            them. This process is repeated 20 times per second. I programmed the microcontroller to
            have two endpoints that send the recorded sensor values: one for the upper arm angle, and
            one for the lower arm angle. Devices that are connected to the microcontroller through WiFi
            can send requests to these endpoints and receive the angle sensor values.
