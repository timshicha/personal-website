        <h2>You found my website!</h2>
        <p><i>If the lack of styling is bugging you, I don't blame you. I have
            yet to get to that. I heard about some job opportunities and wanted
            a way to show off some things I've been working on. I quickly made
            this website and summarized a few of my projects. I will get to styling
            soon.
